# Build-in-Public — LinkedIn Post Drafts

Post 1 — Project Announcement (short)

"Excited to start building a Voice-Controlled Smart Kitchen — a hands-free cooking assistant that finds recipes, guides you step-by-step with audio cues, and can even control smart appliances. I'll be sharing weekly progress, tech details, and learnings as I build in public. Follow along! #VoiceAI #IoT #CookingTech"

Post 2 — Week 1 (docs & design)

"Week 1: Project scaffolded, README and architecture docs completed. Next up: building the voice loop and recipe ingestion pipeline (ScaleDown) for fast local lookups. Planning to run a small UX study when the prototype is ready. #buildinpublic"

Post 3 — Feature Reveal (camera verification)

"Working on a neat feature: optional camera-assisted step verification that gives live visual feedback for tricky steps (e.g., checking for soft peaks). Privacy-first: images processed locally unless you opt-in for server analysis. #AI #ComputerVision"
